xsscrapy
========

Fast, thorough, XSS/SQLi spider. Give it a URL and it'll test every link it finds for cross-site scripting and some SQL injection vulnerabilities. See FAQ for more details about SQLi detection.


From within the main folder run:

```shell
./xsscrapy.py -u http://example.com
```


If you wish to login then crawl:
```shell
./xsscrapy.py -u http://example.com/login_page -l loginname
```

If you wish to login with HTTP Basic Auth then crawl:
```shell
./xsscrapy.py -u http://example.com/login_page -l loginname --basic
```

If you wish to limit simultaneous connections to 20: 
```shell
./xsscrapy.py -u http://example.com -c 20
```

If you want to rate limit to 60 requests per minute: 
```shell
./xsscrapy.py -u http://example.com/ -r 60
```


XSS vulnerabilities are reported in example.com-vulns.txt or xsscrapy-vulns.txt when no domain can be extracted

FAQ
-------

* If it gives an error : ```ImportError: cannot import name LinkExtractor```. This means that you don't have the latest version of scrapy. You can install it using: ```sudo pip install --upgrade scrapy```.
* It's called XSScrapy, so why SQL injection detection too? There is overlap between dangerous XSS chars and dangerous SQL injection characters, namely single and double quotes. Detecting SQL injection errors in a response is also simple and nonCPU-intensive. So although 99% of this script is strongly geared toward high and accurate detection of XSS adding simple SQL injection detection through error message discovery is a simple and effective addition. This script will not test for blind sql injection. Error messages it looks for come straight from w3af's sqli audit plugin.
